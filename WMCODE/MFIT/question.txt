Hi Yall

I am considering using "sequential quadratic programming" (SQP) in Octave (1) to
expand on a software framework I implemented to fit transition matrices to
cross-sectional data (2).

My question is basically: Can I be confident that SQP finds the global optimum
as long as I can prove the problem is convex? If not, why not? Any special
cases? Weird numerics?

I want to expand my framework to handle some of the regularization techniques
and alternative norms presented in B&L (3), chapter 6. Some of the techniques
can implemented by modifying the basic QP matrices, but not all of them (at
least that I can figure out). SQP is much more general, and thus dangerous...

Thanks for looking!
